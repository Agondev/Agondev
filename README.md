<h2>I'm a technophile and enjoy trying to understand the inner workings of some software or hardware by intentionally breaking stuff, disassembling or reassembling them, and finding heuristic solutions to issues.</h2>

<h3>Attentive to detail and a power user. Language, framework, and OS agnostic. Web, desktop, mobile -- anything goes. These days I delve mainly in flutter and blockchain.</h3>

<h4>Fluent in Russian, Hebrew, and English. Presently learning Japanese. Interests include programming, literature, philosophy, psychology, gaming, and music.</h4>
