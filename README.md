<h1 align="center">Hello! Здравствуйте! שלום! 今日は！</h1>

<h2>I'm a technophile and spend a lot of time trying to understand the inner workings of some software or hardware by intentionally breaking stuff, disassembling or reassembling them, and finding heuristic solutions to any issues encountered.</h2>

<h3>Attentive to detail and a power user. Language, framework, and OS agnostic. Web, desktop, mobile -- anything goes. These days I delve mainly in flutter and blockchain.</h3>

<h4>My fascinations include programming, literature, philosophy, psychology, gaming, and music (in case our interests coincide and you'd like to discuss them).</h4>
