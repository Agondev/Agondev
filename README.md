<h1 align="center"> Hi there!</h1>

<h2> I'm a technophile who spends a lot of time doing random tech stuff (i.e., trying to understand the inner workings of some software or hardware, intentionally breaking stuff, disassembling and reassembling stuff, etc.).</h2>

<h3> I enjoy finding heuristic, efficient, and elegant ways of getting things done right.</h3>

<h4> I'm a top-tier power user. Language, framework, and OS agnostic. Web, desktop, mobile -- anything goes. These days I'm mainly interested in flutter and blockchain.</h4>
